Upgrading to 0.6.1

Database doesn't change.
No new settings in the config file.
Just overwrite the project files.

Upgrading to 0.6.0

Due to the switch to migrations in 0.6 and the inclusion of new columns,
there are some things you need to do to ensure that you keep your old data.

1) Dump tables using 'mysqldump -t -c'
2) Drop your old database, and create a new blank one
3) run 'ruby upgrade_to_0.6.rb'
4) Import your old data
