Dependencies:
*ruby/ldap
 Ruby/LDAP must be installed in order to use LDAP user authentication. The website is
 located at the following URL: http://ruby-ldap.sourceforge.net/


System Settings:
*LDAP SSL Connection
 For those of you that elect to use the LDAP user authentication, we use a SSL
 connection for additional security. Here are the following sets that you must follow
 in order to setup an SSL LDAP connection:
   1. Download the root certificate for your LDAP server and save it somewhere in 
      your home directory (e.g. /home/username/.certs/ldap.pem).

   2. Create a file .ldaprc in your home directory with the following content:

      TLS_CACERT /path/to/dal_ldap.pem

   3. Make sure everything is working by running:

      ldapsearch -ZZ -h ldap.dal.ca -x -b 'dc=dal,dc=ca' '(uid=obaltzer)' dn

      If you do not get an error and something like:

      # numResponses: 2
      # numEntries: 1

      then it is working.

Rails Environment settings:
 Before you can start using TigerEvents, you have to update the following constants in config/environment.rb. The
 first below are your LDAP settings.
   #LDAP settings
   LDAP_URL = 'ldap.dal.ca'
   LDAP_PORT = 389
   LDAP_DN = 'dc=dal,dc=ca'

 The second set constant is the identification of the SUPER_USER. This is the user that will have access to the 
 setup pages.
 
   #Declare the super user of the system
   #This is the user which can designate users to be managers and definite the group class hierarchy
   #This user is identified by their login
   SUPER_USER = 'cpjordan'
