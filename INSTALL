If you encounter any problems please submit a bug report on our website
http://www.tigeronrails.com/, send us an email to acm+dev@cs.dal.ca or join
the developers in IRC channel #tigers on the Freenode network
(irc.freenode.net).

Dependencies:

  - Ruby 1.8
  
  - ruby/ldap
    
    Ruby/LDAP must be installed in order to use LDAP user authentication.
    You can obtain the latest Ruby/LDAP distribution from
    http://ruby-ldap.sourceforge.net/.

Setup:

  - run the setup script from the root directory of the distribution using
    the following command:

    ruby setup.rb

    The script will ask you a variety of questions to setup your
    TigerEvents environment

  - Run the Webrick webserver by calling:

    ruby script/server

  - For a production site setup please refer to the Rails documentation in
    README.Rails

System Settings:

  - LDAP SSL Connection
 
    For those of you that elect to use the LDAP user authentication, we use
    a SSL connection for additional security. Here are the following
    settings that you must follow in order to setup an SSL LDAP connection:
    
      1. Download the server certificate for your LDAP server and save it
	 somewhere in the filesystem (e.g. your home directory
	 /home/username/.certs/ldap.pem).

      2. Create a file '.ldaprc' in your home directory or a file 'ldaprc'
	 in the directory from which the application is executed, with the
	 following content:

      		TLS_CACERT /path/to/ldap.pem

      3. You can ensure that everything is working by running:

         ldapsearch -ZZ -h ldap.server -x -b 'dc=search,dc=domain' \
	 		 '(uid=username)' dn

	 If you do not get an error, then the SSL connection is working.

    For details see: http://www.openldap.org/pub/ksoper/OpenLDAP_TLS_howto.html 

  - Rails Environment Setting
  
    Before you can start using TigerEvents, you have to update the
    following constants in config/tigerevents_config.rb.
   
    	#LDAP settings
   
   	# the LDAP server to connect to
	LDAP_URL = 'ldap.somewhere.com'
   	
	# the LDAP port (use 389 for TLS and 636 for SSL)
	LDAP_PORT = 389
   	
	# the search base for LDAP queries
	LDAP_DN = 'dc=dal,dc=ca'
